They bought them at Best Buy in a celestial object bargain. There's 'Woopsie Doopsies', 'Omega-3', 'Justin Bieber', 'The Twinkle' , 'Rosaberta' and 147 other stars. Marco P. and Jenny plan to survive until the 22nd century. How many more stars will they have to buy and name together! Their goal is 325. Only 173 to go.
